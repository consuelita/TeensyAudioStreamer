# Teensy USB Audio WAV Player

A simple WAV file player for Teensy 4.0/4.1 that streams audio via USB.

## Features

- üéµ Plays WAV files from SD card in sequence
- üîÑ Automatic looping through all files
- üéõÔ∏è Serial control interface with commands
- üìä Real-time audio processor and memory usage monitoring
- üîß Automatic error recovery and file rescanning
- üíæ Memory-optimized for stable operation
- üîå USB audio output (works as USB audio device)

## Hardware Requirements

- **Teensy 4.0 or 4.1** microcontroller
- **MicroSD card** (FAT32 formatted recommended)
- **WAV files** stored in the root directory of the SD card

### Connections

- SD card uses the built-in SD card slot on Teensy 4.1, or connect to SPI pins on Teensy 4.0
- USB connection to computer/Android device for audio output
- Serial connection (optional, for control and monitoring)

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** with Teensy support
- **Teensyduino** add-on installed
- **Audio Library** (included with Teensyduino)

### Required Libraries
- `Audio.h` - Teensy Audio Library
- `Wire.h` - I2C communication
- `SPI.h` - SPI communication
- `SerialFlash.h` - Flash memory support

## Installation

1. Install Arduino IDE and Teensyduino from [PJRC website](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Open `teensy_wav_player.ino` in Arduino IDE
4. Select your Teensy board (Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí Teensy 4.0 or 4.1)
5. Set USB Type to "Audio" (Tools ‚Üí USB Type ‚Üí Audio)
6. Upload the sketch to your Teensy

## Usage

### Setup
1. Format your microSD card as FAT32
2. Copy your WAV files to the **root directory** of the SD card
3. Insert the SD card into your Teensy
4. Power up the Teensy and connect via USB

### Supported Audio Formats
- **WAV files** (.wav extension)
- Located in the root directory of the SD card
- Various sample rates and bit depths supported by Teensy Audio Library

### Serial Commands

Connect to the Teensy's serial port (115200 baud) to use these commands:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `n` or `N` | Skip to next track |
| `r` or `R` | Restart current track |
| `s` or `S` | Stop playback |
| `p` or `P` | Play/Resume |
| `f` or `F` | Rescan SD card for files |
| `?`, `h`, or `H` | Show help menu |

### Status Information

The device automatically prints status information every 2 seconds, including:
- Currently playing file
- Track position (X of Y)
- Playback status
- Processor usage percentage
- Memory usage
- Available commands

## Configuration

You can modify these parameters in the code:

```cpp
#define SDCARD_CS_PIN 10
#define MAX_FILES 20              // Maximum WAV files to scan
#define MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES 5 // Max failures before rescan
const unsigned long STATUS_INTERVAL = 2000; // Status print interval (ms)
AudioMemory(25);                  // Audio memory blocks
```

## Troubleshooting

### SD Card Issues
- Ensure that SDCARD_CS_PIN is set to the correct pin for your specific hardware situation
- Ensure SD card is properly formatted (FAT32 recommended)
- Check that WAV files are in the root directory
- Verify SD card connections are secure
- Try a different SD card if problems persist

### Audio Issues
- Verify USB Type is set to "Audio" in Arduino IDE
- Check that your device recognizes the Teensy as a USB audio device
- Ensure WAV files are not corrupted
- Try reducing `AudioMemory()` if experiencing stability issues

### Serial Output Corruption
- This version uses memory-optimized code to prevent corruption
- If issues persist, try reducing `MAX_FILES` or `AudioMemory()`

### No Files Found
- Ensure WAV files have `.wav` extension (case insensitive)
- Check that files are in the root directory, not in folders
- Use the 'f' command to manually rescan for files

## Technical Details

- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for SD card and playback failures
- **Audio Buffer**: x audio memory blocks (configurable)
- **File Limit**: Supports up to x WAV files (configurable)
- **Stability**: No recursive calls to prevent stack overflow
